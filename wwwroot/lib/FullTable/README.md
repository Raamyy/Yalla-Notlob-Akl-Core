# jquery-fulltable

This plugin defines a function of JQuery API called FullTable, which enables both initializate and operate any table, rendering, in addition, all the DOMs needed to be controlled by user.

## Installation

This requires jQuery 1.7.2+. Really, it has not been tested yet for older versions. Once the javascript code and stylesheet has been included in the page, and so as to initializate any table as FullTable, and supposing that this table can be queried by "#fulltable-test" selector, it is only needed to invoke:

	$("#fulltable-test").FullTable(); 

It should be noted that all class names and data keys used by this plugin starts by "fulltable-", so is highly recommended to avoid this kind of names in the environment where the plugin is running.
